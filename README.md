#### Website content:
- Everything in this website is fictive. I've generated most of the content with AI, such as the addresses, the menu's, the events, etc.
- Some of the pictures were generated with AI from [Dall-e](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/).
- I also used some images from [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/). They are free to use and you can read about their terms of use [here](https://unsplash.com/license) 

#### Website design:
The positioning, placements and design are done with bootstrap. The goal of this exercise was to understand the bootstrap css-framework.
I got through the exercise thanks to the great [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/) and a lot of Googling.

#### Branches:
- Main: Is deployed on github pages
- Dev: Branch used for the first version. the navbar links to the different sections on the page making it scroll.
- pages: Branch used for the version with a separate page for each link in the navbar
